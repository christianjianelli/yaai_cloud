# yaai_cloud - ABAP AI tools Cloud
This repository provides a set of tools designed to facilitate Artificial Intelligence capabilities within **ABAP Cloud** environments.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Provider LLM API Support**: ABAP AI tools Cloud support seamless integration with multiple large language model APIs, giving you flexibility in choosing your provider and deployment model. The list of supported APIs will continue to grow as the project evolves. Currently supported APIs include:
  - **[OpenAI](docs/openai/README.md)**
  - **[Google Gemini](docs/google/README.md)**
  - **[Anthropic](docs/anthropic/README.md)** 
  - APIs from other providers, such as Nvidia and Mistral, that implement the OpenAI API standards also work with ABAP AI tools Could, possibly requiring minor adjustments.
    - **[Mistral](docs/openai_compatible/mistral.md)** (cloud-based)
- **Conversation Management**: Maintain and manage multi-turn conversations, with full access to conversation history for advanced chat scenarios.
- **Tool/Function Calling**: Integrate ABAP business logic with LLMs using function/tool calling, allowing AI models to trigger ABAP methods.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhance LLM outputs by incorporating enterprise data, enabling more accurate and relevant answers through retrieval-augmented generation workflows.

These features empower you to build intelligent, enterprise-ready ABAP applications that leverage the latest advancements in AI.

## Quickstart

### Running Your First ABAP AI Cloud Application

This quickstart demonstrates how to create a simple LLM application. It shows you how to connect to the LLM and perform a basic chat interaction.

**Requirements:** 
*   You have a valid OpenAI API Key.

**Steps:**
1.  Create an ABAP AI Connection instance;
2.  Set the Base URL;
3.  Set the API Key;
4.  Create an ABAP AI OpenAI instance;
5.  Call the CHAT method.

**Example:**
```abap
CLASS zcl_aaic_example_openai DEFINITION
  PUBLIC
  FINAL
  CREATE PUBLIC.

  PUBLIC SECTION.

    INTERFACES if_oo_adt_classrun.

  PROTECTED SECTION.
  PRIVATE SECTION.
ENDCLASS.

CLASS zcl_aaic_example_openai IMPLEMENTATION.

  METHOD if_oo_adt_classrun~main.

    DATA: l_api_key TYPE string,
          l_message TYPE string.

    DATA(lo_aaic_conn) = NEW ycl_aaic_conn( i_api = yif_aaic_const=>c_openai ).

    lo_aaic_conn->set_api_key( i_api_key = l_api_key ).

    DATA(lo_aaic_openai) = NEW ycl_aaic_openai( i_model = 'gpt-5-nano'
                                                i_o_connection = lo_aaic_conn ).

    l_message = 'Hi there! What is the capital of France?'.

    lo_aaic_openai->chat(
      EXPORTING
        i_message    = l_message
      IMPORTING
        e_t_response = DATA(lt_response)
    ).

    out->write( lt_response ).

  ENDMETHOD.

ENDCLASS.
``` 

**How to run:**
1. Set a breakpoint on the `set_api_key` method call (`lo_aaic_conn->set_api_key( i_api_key = l_api_key ).`).
2. Press F9 to execute the code.
3. In the debugger, set the value of the variable `l_api_key` to your actual API key.
4. Press F8 to continue execution.
