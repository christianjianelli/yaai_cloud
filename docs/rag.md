## Introduction: Why RAG Matters
Every SAP system is unique, filled with custom "Z-processes" and enhancements that go far beyond standard documentation. A Large Language Model (LLM), no matter how advanced, cannot know your company's specific "ZRET" goods return process. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) bridges this gap by connecting AI to your organization's private knowledge base.

## What is RAG?
RAG is a technique that boosts the accuracy and relevance of LLM responses by retrieving information from your internal documentation. Instead of relying solely on generic training data, RAG enables the LLM to access up-to-date, company-specific knowledge, making its answers factual and tailored to your processes.

## Implementing RAG using Vector Databases

### Step 1: Building the Knowledge Base
Imagine your company manages customer returns through a custom transaction, "ZRET." The rules are scattered across Word documents and PDFs on internal servers. Before RAG can answer questions, you must build a searchable knowledge base:

1. **Gather and Curate:** Collect all relevant documentation for the "ZRET" process, including Word, PDF, and text files from various repositories.
2. **Chunk and Process:** Break documents into smaller, logical sections (such as paragraphs or topics). This makes retrieval precise and efficient.
3. **Embed and Store:** Use an embedding model to convert each chunk into a numerical vector representing its meaning. Store these vectors and their original text in a specialized **Vector Database**.

This transforms your unstructured documentation into an organized, searchable digital library—ready for real-time queries.

### Step 2: The RAG Workflow
The RAG process consists of three main steps:

1. **Retrieve:** When you ask a question, the system searches your knowledge base for relevant information.
2. **Augment:** The retrieved information is attached to your original query, giving the LLM essential context.
3. **Generate:** The LLM uses this augmented prompt to generate a precise, fact-based answer.

### Example Scenario
Suppose a new team member asks:

*"For the ZRET process, what are the approval steps required for a customer return valued over €10,000?"*

A standard LLM cannot answer this, as "ZRET" is unique to your company. Here’s how RAG solves the problem:

1. **Understanding the Query:** The system converts the user's question into a vector using the same embedding model.
2. **Semantic Search:** It searches the Vector Database for documentation chunks most similar to the query—understanding meaning, not just keywords.
3. **Grounded Answer Generation:** The most relevant text is retrieved and combined with the original question. The LLM receives an augmented prompt like:

    > *Context from internal documents: "For all returns processed via transaction ZRET with a value exceeding €10,000, approval from both the regional Sales Manager and the Finance Controller is mandatory. Approvals must be logged in the ZRET_APPR table."*
    >
    > *User's Question: For the ZRET process, what are the approval steps required for a customer return valued over €10,000?*

Armed with precise, company-specific facts, the LLM can now generate a trustworthy answer and cite its source.
